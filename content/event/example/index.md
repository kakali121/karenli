summary: A Novel Low-Cost, Recyclable, Easy-to-Build Robot Blimp For Transporting Supplies in Hard-to-Reach Locations
abstract: 'Rural communities in remote areas often encounter significant challenges when it comes to accessing emergency and essential supplies due to a lack of adequate transportation infrastructure. The situation is further exacerbated by poorly maintained or damaged roads. Limited budgets and technological constraints pose additional obstacles. The transportation of crucial resources, such as medical supplies. In light of these obstacles, our objective is to improve accessibility and alleviate the suffering of vulnerable populations by automating transportation tasks using low-cost robotic systems. We propose a low-cost, easy-to-build blimp robot (UAVs), that can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of local emergency responses'
