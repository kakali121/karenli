## About Me

I am a first year Robotics PhD student at [REACT](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/) lab at Harvard University working with [Prof. Stephanie Gil](https://gil.seas.harvard.edu/). 

Before joining REACT lab, I obtained my BS in Computer Science at Lehigh University, where I worked as an undergraduate researcher at [AIR](https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/robotics/) lab, under the supervision of [Prof. David Saldaña](https://swarmslab.com/david-saldana/).
